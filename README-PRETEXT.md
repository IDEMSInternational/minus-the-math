1. Install PreTeXt CLI from requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up PreTeXt cache (workaround for known bug in PreTeXt 2.32.0):
   ```bash
   bash .github/scripts/setup-pretext-cache.sh
   ```

3. Copy images to external directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p external
   cp -r docs/Images external/
   ```

### Build Commands

#### Build HTML version:
```bash
pretext build html
```

#### Build PDF version:
```bash
pretext build pdf
```

#### Build LaTeX version:
```bash
pretext build latex
```

#### View the HTML output:
```bash
pretext view html
```

## Output

Built files will be placed in the `output/` directory:
- `output/html/` - HTML version
- `output/pdf/` - PDF version
- `output/latex/` - LaTeX source files

## GitHub Pages Deployment

The book is automatically built and deployed to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The workflow:

1. Installs PreTeXt CLI
2. Builds the HTML version of the book
3. Deploys the HTML output to GitHub Pages

You can also manually trigger the deployment from the Actions tab in the GitHub repository.

### Prerequisites for GitHub Pages

Ensure that GitHub Pages is enabled in your repository settings:
1. Go to Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
